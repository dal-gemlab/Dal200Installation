        <p class="desc">
            She completed a master's in mathematics at MIT, where she gained exposure to computer technology. With a shortage of jobs in computing in Canada, she was able to negotiate a position as a project assistant at the University of Toronto’s newly established Computation Centre for a purported salary of $200 per month.

        <h2 class="catch-ttl">DIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER</h2>
        <p class="desc">
            She built a differential analyzer: an early mechanical analog computer that could solve equations using Meccano parts. She also worked on IBM's punch calculator together with fellow project supervisors.

        <h2 class="catch-ttl">DOCTORATE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE</h2>
        <p class="desc">
            She visited the Mathematical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge to learn about an early computer called the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). She is considered as the first female to complete a Ph.D. in computer science, in 1952.
