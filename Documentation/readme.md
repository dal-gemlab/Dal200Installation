# Dal 200 Installation: Documentation

There are currently three computers running the installation: two mac minis running projectors and a tablet running the management software. Websockets are used for communicating between machines.

When connected to the Installation wifi network you can use VNC to interact with the machines using the following names:

* Dal200Wall
* Dal200Floor
* lowerkinect

## Windows Tablet

The Windows tablet has several functions:

1. communicating with the Kinect tracker
2. running the top-down tracking software, which sends tracked positions via OSC to the Manager porgram
3. running the Manager program

## Mac Mini #1: Floor Display

This mini is connected to the floor projector; its role is to display dwell targets and a round 'cursor' that follows the user on the floor.

There is a script running on this machine named "keep_running_floor". It will restart applications as necessary, so if things get messed up simply quit all running applications and wait or restart the machine.
